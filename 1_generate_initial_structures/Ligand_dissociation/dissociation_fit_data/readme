This is a python3 script to fit a function to given data.

It uses the numpy, scipy, and matplotlib libraries. In order to run the script,
these libraries must be installed on your computer. The easiest way is by
downloading them directly. For example, in ubuntu, open the terminal and
run the command:

sudo apt-get install python3-numpy python3-scipy python3-matplotlib

On some python installations it is possible to encounter an issue with
the plot not showing, even though the script runs and performs the fit.
This is usually because of incompatible settings for the python backend.
One possible solution is to run the following list of commands:

Download the tk backend:
1) sudo apt-get install tcl-dev tk-dev python-tk python3-tk

Install the locate command:
2) sudo apt-get install locate

In order to find the location of the matplotlib configuration file:
3) locate matplotlibrc

In order to edit the matplotlib configuration file:
4) sudo vi /etc/matplotlibrc (or whatever the output of locate is)

by:
5) seting in matplotlibrc the line "backend      : something" 
to "backend      : TkAgg"
