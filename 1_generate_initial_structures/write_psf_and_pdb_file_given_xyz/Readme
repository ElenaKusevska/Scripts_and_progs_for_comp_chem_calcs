Script to write a PSF (Protein Structure File) and PDB (Protein
Data Bank) file, given an xyz (molecular geometry) file.

Run the script on the command line in the same directory as the PDB file.
An input file and the file "read_test_mod.py" must also be present in 
the directory. This program is specific to linux operating systems.

The default name of the input file is "input". If you want to use a 
different file name for the input file, run the script with a -i option, 
followed by the desired name of the input file. The input file contains 
the name of the PDB file, information about the ranges of bond lengths 
for the atoms in the molecule, as well as information about atomic 
charges, if available. An example of the formatting of the input file
is provided here.

The program identifies the bonds in the molecular structure in the PDB
by constructing the connectivity matrix of the molecule using the 
information about the bond lengths and bond orders provided in the input 
file. It then uses the information in the connectivity matrix to
identify the angles and dihedrals by testing all possible 3-combinations
of the atoms in the molecule for the presence of an angle, and 
4-combinations of the atoms in the molecule for the presence of a
dihedral.

The resulting PSF and PDB files have the same file name as the xyz file, but
with the .psf and .pdb extensions. Another file with the same name and a
.output extension is also generated. In the .output file the script prints
all the information that was read from the input and PDB files, as well
as the distance matrix. This is useful in debuggin the program.

IMPORTANT: This script overwrites all the files that it creates. If a PSF
or PDB or .output file of the same name was present in the directory before
running the script, it will be overwritten.
