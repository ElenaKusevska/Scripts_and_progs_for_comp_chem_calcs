# I had a program that would generate initial structures and inputs 
# using three different stochastic algorithms. This is a script, for
# when the outputs come out of the computational center, to separate
# them in three different folders based on the method that was used
# to prepare the initial structure. Because I wanted to look at each of
# the three methods separately, and see which one gave the best initial
# structures.

# one directory for each method:
# (the names are weird because of fortran format - they all
# had the same number of characters)
mkdir combine_from_grid random_coordinate coordinate_walkin 

# the inputs/outputs for every calculation are in folders named 1, 2, 
# 3, ...
