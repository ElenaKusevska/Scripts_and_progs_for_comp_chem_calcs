Note on using guess=(mix,always)
-----------------------------------------

You can use it in BOMD and in optimizations for open shell structures,
especially in cases where an open shell singlet is collapsing to a
singlet.

Requests that a new initial guess be generated at each point of an 
optimization. By default, the SCF results from the last point are used for 
the guess at the next point

In QST3 and irc: Note that the SCF wavefunction for structures in the 
reactant valley may be quite different from that of structures in the 
product valley. Guess=Always can be used to prevent the wavefunction of a 
reactant-like structure from being used as a guess for the wavefunction of 
a product-like structure.

--------------------------------------------
In general (when you have no idea what 
your most stable wave function is) :
--------------------------------------------

1) After opt freq calculation

2) Run stability check with:
   stable guess=read Geom=Checkpoint

3) If not stable:
   
   A) change to higher spin and run: stable Geom=Checkpoint (u)
   B) change to higher spin and run: stable guess=mix Geom=Checkpoint (u)
   C) keep same spin and run: stable guess=mix Geom=Checkpoint (u)

4) Alternatively, try substituting stable guess=mix with stable=opt in 3)
   
   # Guess=mix mixes the alpha and beta symmetries of the initial guess
   in order to generate a symmetry-broken wavefunction (for example if
   an open shell singlet has lower energy)
   # stable=opt varies the parameters on the wavefunction in order to
   find a wavefunction that satisfies the stability requirement.

# Guess=Read
#    Reads the initial guess from the checkpoint file. If the basis set
#    specified is different from the basis set used in the job which
#    generated the checkpoint file, then the wave function will be
#    projected from one basis to the other. This is an efficient way to
#    switch from one basis to another.

# Possible outputs when using stable:
#     The wavefunction has an RHF -> UHF instability.
#     The wavefunction has an internal instability
#     The wavefunction is stable under the perturbations considered.

------------------------------------------------------------
In your case. Since you were already looking for an open 
shell singlet. After the opt freq job, you can:
------------------------------------------------------------

Either

1) Run stable guess=read Geom=Checkpoint
   And look for "stable"/"instability" output

Or

2) Run stable=opt guess=read Geom=Checkpoint
   And look for "stable"/"instability" output
   Also. If the wavefunction was not stable, it will be optimized, so
   two single point energies will be displayed. First is unstable 
   second is stabilized

And also:

3) For the subsequent single point calculation, use stable=opt
   without guess=read. Or maybe you can do guess=read as well
   because of basis set changes by projecting smaller basis onto
   larger one
