Note: add function to pump dihedralsof conformers in a matrix of dihedrals
where each row is one conformer. For every new conformer check
diherdrals against previously generated ones. If after 20 runs there
are no 8 unique conformers. Probably molecule does not have
many low lying isomers. So, quit program with what you have.
