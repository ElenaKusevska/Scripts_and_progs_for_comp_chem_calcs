Clean up all those separate lines for write '\n'

Get it to print out more information about what the energy was
at each step, and which mol object was printed to gaussian input
file at the final step

make that whole process of set - gradients... etc. a function. Will make
code simpler.

Actually. I'm not sure if this is a good idea just yet. Whether it will
make the code more clear, or not...
